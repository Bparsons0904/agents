# Claude Instructions for MCP Agent System

## Project Overview

This is a fully implemented MCP (Model Context Protocol) server featuring a multi-agent workflow system for comprehensive software development. The system uses Ollama with qwen2.5-coder:14b-instruct-q6_K for local LLM inference and provides secure, restricted code implementation capabilities through orchestrated agent collaboration.

**NEW**: Interactive WebSocket system enables real-time collaboration between Claude Code and Product Managers, reducing Claude Code token usage by 90-95% while maintaining high-quality implementations through guided decision-making.

## Architecture

- **MCP Server** (`mcp-server/`): Go-based HTTP server with multi-agent orchestration
- **Interactive WebSocket Server** (`mcp-websocket`): Real-time bidirectional communication for guided workflows
- **Stdio MCP Server** (`mcp-stdio`): Standard MCP protocol compliance for Claude Code integration
- **Multi-Agent System**: Engineering Manager, Senior Engineer, Senior QA, Senior Tech Lead
- **Ollama Service**: Local LLM inference with qwen2.5-coder:14b-instruct-q6_K model
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates both services with shared networking
- **Security**: Command restrictions and filesystem boundaries

- **Detailed Feedback**: Specific issues with examples and required actions
- **EM Routing**: All rejections route back through Engineering Manager for coordination
- **Auto-Fix Capability**: Applies formatting/linting fixes automatically (doesn't reject for these)

#### ⚡ Enhanced Review Process
1. **Requirements Analysis** → Validate EM brief success criteria
2. **Security Scanning** → Zero-tolerance vulnerability detection  
3. **Duplication Analysis** → Prevent unnecessary code duplication
4. **Pattern Validation** → Enforce established conventions
5. **Auto-Fix Application** → Apply formatting and linting improvements
6. **Final Assessment** → Approve or provide structured rejection feedback

## Development Guidelines

### File Organization Standards

- **ALL test files must go in `test-projects/` directory**
- **Never create test JSON files in project root**
- Test files include: `*test*.json`, `*-test.json`, `quick-test.json`, etc.
- Use existing `.gitignore` patterns to prevent test file clutter
- Keep project root clean and organized

### Go Code Standards

- Use camelCase for file names (per user preference)
- Follow existing patterns in agent/ and tools/ packages
- Implement proper error handling with context
- Use interfaces for testability (LLMClient, ToolSet, CommandRestrictions)

### Security Requirements

- ALL commands must be validated against allowlist in `agent.toml`
- File operations restricted to project directory scope
- No sudo, rm -rf, or system-level operations allowed
- Path traversal protection for all file access

### Configuration Management

- Use TOML for all configuration files
- Support both file-based and environment variable configuration
- Graceful fallbacks to sensible defaults
- Clear validation with helpful error messages

### Token Efficiency Benefits

#### **Traditional Claude Code Approach**:
- Read entire codebase context: ~5K-50K tokens
- Generate implementation: ~5K-20K tokens  
- Review and iterate: ~10K-30K tokens per iteration
- **Total**: 26K-145K tokens per feature

#### **With Agent System**:
- Send feature request: ~200 tokens
- Receive progress updates: ~50 tokens each
- Answer decision queries: ~100-500 tokens each
- Receive final result: ~1K tokens
- **Total**: 2K-5K tokens per feature (**90-95% reduction!**)

### Usage Examples

#### **Simple Feature Addition**:
```
Claude Code: "Add a /health endpoint to my Go API that returns server status"

Agent System Response:
→ Auto-detects your current project
→ EM analyzes existing patterns  
→ Engineer implements endpoint following project conventions
→ QA adds tests
→ Tech Lead reviews for security and consistency
→ Returns: Complete implementation with tests
```

#### **Interactive Decision Making**:
```
Claude Code: "Add user authentication to my API"

Interactive Flow:
Agent: "Found JWT and Session patterns in codebase. Which should I use?"
PM: "JWT - we're standardizing on that"
Agent: "Implementing JWT authentication..."
→ Continues with guided implementation
```
