# Claude Instructions for MCP Agent System

## Project Overview

This is a fully implemented MCP (Model Context Protocol) server featuring a multi-agent workflow system for comprehensive software development. The system uses Ollama with Qwen3:14b-q4_K_M for local LLM inference and provides secure, restricted code implementation capabilities through orchestrated agent collaboration.

## Architecture

- **MCP Server** (`mcp-server/`): Go-based HTTP server with multi-agent orchestration
- **Multi-Agent System**: Engineering Manager, Senior Engineer, Senior QA, Senior Tech Lead
- **Ollama Service**: Local LLM inference with Qwen3:14b-q4_K_M model
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates both services with shared networking
- **Security**: Command restrictions and filesystem boundaries

### Multi-Agent Workflow

The system implements a complete software development workflow:

1. **Engineering Manager**: Analyzes requirements, reads project context (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md), creates structured implementation briefs
2. **Senior Engineer**: Implements features based on EM structured briefs with enhanced error categorization
3. **Senior QA Engineer**: Analyzes implementations via git diff, writes comprehensive tests
4. **Senior Tech Lead**: Comprehensive quality review with security analysis, pattern validation, and structured rejections

**Workflow Flow**: EM ‚Üí Engineer ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Tech Lead ‚Üí Complete
**Smart Routing**: Dynamic agent transitions with enhanced coordination and structured feedback loops

### Enhanced Tech Lead Capabilities

The Tech Lead agent has been significantly enhanced with comprehensive review capabilities:

#### üîí Security Analysis (Zero Tolerance)
- **SQL Injection Detection**: Identifies string concatenation in SQL queries
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Detects unsafe file operations with user input  
- **Input Validation**: Ensures request binding includes proper validation
- **Secret Detection**: Identifies hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens
- **Resource Leak Prevention**: Checks for unclosed files, connections, goroutines
- **Unsafe Deserialization**: Validates JSON/XML parsing with proper checks

#### üìã Requirements Validation
- **EM Brief Analysis**: Validates implementation against Engineering Manager's success criteria
- **Task Completion Verification**: Ensures core requirements are fully implemented
- **Endpoint Validation**: Confirms required APIs and functionality are present
- **Build Verification**: Validates code compiles and meets technical requirements

#### üîÑ Duplication Detection
- **Function Analysis**: Detects similar functions across related files (80%+ similarity threshold)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies duplicate business logic and validation patterns
- **Scope-Aware Scanning**: Analyzes same package, utility functions, and related functionality
- **Smart File Matching**: Handlers‚Üíhandlers, services‚Üíservices, models‚Üímodels

#### üìê Pattern Consistency
- **Documentation Integration**: Validates against established patterns in `/agents/patterns/`
- **Handler Patterns**: Ensures consistent function signatures and response formats
- **Error Handling**: Validates proper error wrapping and context preservation
- **Architecture Compliance**: Enforces project-specific conventions and standards

#### üîÑ Structured Rejection System
- **Four Rejection Categories**: Requirements, Security, Duplication, Patterns
- **Detailed Feedback**: Specific issues with examples and required actions
- **EM Routing**: All rejections route back through Engineering Manager for coordination
- **Auto-Fix Capability**: Applies formatting/linting fixes automatically (doesn't reject for these)

#### ‚ö° Enhanced Review Process
1. **Requirements Analysis** ‚Üí Validate EM brief success criteria
2. **Security Scanning** ‚Üí Zero-tolerance vulnerability detection  
3. **Duplication Analysis** ‚Üí Prevent unnecessary code duplication
4. **Pattern Validation** ‚Üí Enforce established conventions
5. **Auto-Fix Application** ‚Üí Apply formatting and linting improvements
6. **Final Assessment** ‚Üí Approve or provide structured rejection feedback

## Development Guidelines

### Go Code Standards

- Use camelCase for file names (per user preference)
- Follow existing patterns in agent/ and tools/ packages
- Implement proper error handling with context
- Use interfaces for testability (LLMClient, ToolSet, CommandRestrictions)

### Security Requirements

- ALL commands must be validated against allowlist in `agent.toml`
- File operations restricted to project directory scope
- No sudo, rm -rf, or system-level operations allowed
- Path traversal protection for all file access

### Configuration Management

- Use TOML for all configuration files
- Support both file-based and environment variable configuration
- Graceful fallbacks to sensible defaults
- Clear validation with helpful error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ollama "unhealthy"**: Normal during model download, wait for completion
2. **MCP build failures**: Check Go module dependencies with `go mod tidy`
3. **Command restrictions**: Verify allowlist in `config/agent.toml`
4. **File access denied**: Ensure paths are within project directory

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a

# View detailed logs
docker logs agent-ollama --tail 50
docker logs agent-mcp-server --tail 50

# Test Ollama directly
docker exec agent-ollama ollama list
```

## Important Notes

### Security Considerations

- This is a development/testing environment
- Production deployments need additional security hardening
- GPU access required for optimal Ollama performance
- Network isolation recommended for production

### Performance

- **Model**: Qwen3:14b-q4_K_M requires ~9GB VRAM for optimal performance
- **Workflow Duration**: 2-5 minutes for typical multi-agent features
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient quantized model (q4_K_M) for resource optimization
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for model loading speed
- **Scaling**: Consider qwen3:8b for systems with limited VRAM

### Claude Code Integration

- Server runs on port 8080 for MCP protocol communication
- Standard JSON-RPC format for tool calls
- Designed for integration with Claude Code's MCP client
